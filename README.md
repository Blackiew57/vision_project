# Computer Vision Project 

This project was developed as part of a Computer Vision class at SahmYook University. The project includes a implementation of panorama stitching and image filtering using the OpenCV library.

## Features

- **Panorama Creation**: Combine multiple images to create a single panoramic view.
- **Image Filtering**: Apply various filters to images for different effects.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** : 3.10 or higher
- **OpenCV**: For image processing functions.
- **PyInstaller**: Package the project into an executable file (.exe) for Windows.
- **Custom Icons**: Each .exe file icon was customized with Dogecoin and Shiba Inu coin icons.
- **For more** : please read requirements.txt

## Running the Project

The project has been compiled into a Windows executable file, which can be run without needing Python installed. Although you can't download through my github, you can create your own `.exe` file using Pyinstaller. To make your own `.exe` open Terminal and type `pyinstaller -w -F panorama.py` or `pyinstaller -w -F filter.py`. You can also add your own icon.
